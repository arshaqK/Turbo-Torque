## Introduction

Turbo-Torque is a modern web application that simplifies the car marketplace by providing a clean, intuitive interface for buyers and sellers. Users can browse available vehicles, list their own cars for sale, and communicate securelyâ€”all within a streamlined Next.js and React-powered frontend.

This project was built as part of our Software Engineering course, incorporating best practices in:

- Modular frontend architecture with React components
- Server-side rendering and API routes via Next.js
- Continuous integration of testing and code quality checks

---

## Features

- Browse and search car listings with filters (make, model, year, price)
- User authentication and profile management
- Create, update, and remove car sale posts
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile
- Secure messaging between buyers and sellers

---

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes (or your preferred Node.js/Express server)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (or MongoDB) for persistent storage
- **Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library

---

## Architecture & Development Process

### System Architecture

Turbo-Torque follows a component-based architecture:

1. **Presentation Layer**: React components for UI, styled with Tailwind CSS
2. **Application Layer**: Next.js API routes handling business logic
3. **Data Layer**: Database models and ORM for persistent storage

### Agile Sprints

The development of Turbo-Torque was organized into **three 2-week sprints**:

| Sprint  | Goals                                     | Outcomes                              |
|---------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Sprint 1| Project setup, Next.js scaffolding, core UI components | Completed homepage, navbar, basic routing |
| Sprint 2| User authentication, profile management, database integration | Implemented sign-up/login flow, user dashboard |
| Sprint 3| Listing management, search filters, messaging, testing | CRUD for listings, search page, end-to-end testing |

Regular sprint planning, daily stand-ups, and retrospectives ensured continuous feedback and course correction.

## Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/turbo-torque.git
   cd turbo-torque
   ```
2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Environment variables**
   Create a `.env.local` file at the root:
   ```env
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/turbo_torque
   NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
   NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_secret_key
   ```
4. **Run the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

Your app should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Testing

### Blackbox Testing

Blackbox tests were performed to verify functional behavior without knowledge of internal code structure. Key scenarios included:

- User signup and login flows across browsers
- Creating, editing, and deleting car listings
- Search filters returning correct results based on input
- Message sending and notification delivery

These tests were documented in test plans and executed manually by QA team members.

### Whitebox Testing

Whitebox (unit and integration) tests were implemented using Jest and React Testing Library:

- **Unit tests** for React components (e.g., form validation, button behavior)
- **Integration tests** for API routes and database models
- Coverage reports generated with `--coverage` flag

---

## Usage

1. Navigate to the homepage and create an account or sign in.
2. Browse listings or use the filter options to narrow results.
3. Click "Sell Your Car" to create a new listing (title, description, price, images).
4. Message other users directly from the listing page.
